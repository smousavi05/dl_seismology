The method relies on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) and supervised learning to improve the detection capabilities at 3C seismic stations. A time-frequency decomposition provides the basis for the required signal characteristics we need in order to derive the features defining typical ‘‘signal’’ and ‘‘noise’’ patterns. Each pattern class is modeled by a DBN, specifying the interrelationships of the derived features in the time-frequency plane. Subsequently, the models are trained using previously labeled segments of seismic data. The DBN models can now be compared against in order to determine the likelihood of new incoming seismic waveform segments to be either signal or noise."

In the first step, a kernel convolution followed by a max pooling operation is used to automatically extract features from short windows of 3C waveforms recorded by each station and reducing their dimension. This step can be viewed as a station-level data compression. In the next step, a graph-partitioning method is used to divide the seismic stations into a few clusters of presumably more correlated stations based on their adjacency in a graph representation, and then extracted features from stations in each cluster are aggregated to perform a network-level compression. This compact representation of seismic observation across the array in the feature space, is then used by the subsequent layers of the neural network for reasoning and classifying the observation as either earthquake or non-earthquake event. The core idea is that the observed waveforms at nearby stations correlate with each other in the feature space, thus by stacking (average pooling) of them and improving the feature representation, the performance could be improved as opposed to naive multi-station deep-learning approaches. The method seems to be not very flexible with the number and geometry of the stations, depending on the event-station distributions, and the hyperparameters used for graph partitioning."

Their data set was, however, undersampled for such goal, with fewer than 500 images for training (and fewer than 100 for testing). They generated the images by encoding earthquake magnitude by brightness, considering all events occurring over a period of 120 days (little detail is given about minimum magnitude considered and how event magnitudes are aggregated per pixel). They labeled those images as 1 if the largest earthquake magnitude in the next 30 days was greater than or equal to 6, and as 0 otherwise.

In this approach the 3D gird space of the region of interest is represented by a 3D output volume of a CNN in which the closest grid point to the ground truth hypocenter is labeled by a 3D Gaussian function. Hence, this is classification approach in which the input observed waveform across a seismic network is directly classified into the grid-space of the network output representing a potential hypocenter solution. Hence, in addition to the issues in the other multi-station approaches, the resolution of the location estimates is bounded by the number grid points (classes) in the 3D output volume of the neural network which itself is controlled by the number of CNN layers. Thus, in such a many-class classification problem, the increase of output dimension of the neural network beside the large input dimension (due to the use of multi-station data) increases the non-linearity of the learning system. Although this can be compensated by a butterfly architecture to some extend, it still pose more challenge for training of a multi-station network which generally suffers from more limited training data and is more prone to overfitting.

They start with enhancing individual seismic traces based on their neighboring information. From the enhanced seismic traces, the spatially aligned feature maps can be learned and further concatenated to reconstruct a velocity model. This allows that each seismic trace contributes to the reconstruction of the whole velocity model by finding spatial correspondence. An encoder–decoder architecture for VMB was proposed in which the network is composed of three sections: 1) an embedding encoder, which maps the traces in each shot gather to embedded vectors; 2) a spatially aligned feature generator, which transforms the embedded vectors to feature maps that are spatially aligned to the velocity model; and 3) a velocity model decoder, which reconstructs the velocity model from the feature maps.
